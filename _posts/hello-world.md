In this article, we will explore how to use static generation in Next.js to improve performance and SEO for your web applications. Static generation allows you to pre-render pages at build time, which means that the HTML is generated once and served to all users, resulting in faster load times and better search engine indexing.

Next.js provides a simple way to implement static generation using the `getStaticProps` function. This function fetches data at build time and passes it as props to your page component. By leveraging static generation, you can create a highly optimized web application that delivers a great user experience.

## Understanding Static Generation

Static generation is particularly useful for pages that can be pre-rendered, such as blog posts, product listings, or marketing pages. By generating these pages ahead of time, you can serve them quickly to users without the need for server-side rendering on each request.

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up static generation in your Next.js application, including how to fetch data from an API and render it on your pages.
