Dynamic routing allows you to create pages that can change based on the URL, making your application more flexible and user-friendly. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require user-generated content or dynamic data.

Dynamic routing in Next.js is achieved by using the file system as the main API for routing. By creating a file structure that reflects your desired routes, you can easily set up dynamic routes using square brackets. For example, if you want to create a blog post page that can handle different slugs, you would create a file named `[slug].js` inside the `pages/posts` directory.

## Understanding Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing is essential for building applications that need to display different content based on user input or external data. For instance, an e-commerce site might use dynamic routing to display product details based on the product ID in the URL.

This approach allows for a more engaging user experience, as users can navigate directly to specific content without unnecessary page reloads. It also improves SEO by allowing search engines to index each unique URL.

## Conclusion

Dynamic routing in Next.js is a powerful feature that enhances the flexibility of your application. By combining it with static generation, you can create fast, SEO-friendly pages that provide a great user experience. In this article, we covered the basics of setting up dynamic routes and how to fetch data for those routes, paving the way for more complex applications.
